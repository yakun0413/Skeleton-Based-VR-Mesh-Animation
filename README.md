This research focuses on developing a system that leverages the Kinect skeleton model and the Oculus Rift headset to enhance motion capture and computer animation in virtual 3D environments. By utilizing a 3D sensor device, skeleton points of a person can be extracted and utilized in physical therapy sessions, providing valuable optical feedback. The implementation of the system involves C++ programming and OpenGL rendering, supported by essential tools such as C++ vectors, the Assimp library, and the C++ Timer Wrapper. Extensive testing has been conducted, demonstrating the systemâ€™s ability to achieve realistic human movements with low latency and high frame rates. The results contribute significantly to the advancement of motion capture and computer animation, particularly in the context of virtual reality. The most important outcomes of this research are the successful integration of the Kinect skeleton model with the Oculus Rift headset, enabling accurate and immersive motion capture in virtual environments.
In this thesis, part of the code of OculusRoomTiny will be used as the basis. As mentioned above, developers can focus on creating immersive virtual experiences without worrying about low-level technical details.
